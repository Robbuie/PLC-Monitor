# Changelog

One section per version. The release workflow copies the matching section onto
the GitHub release page. The same entries are at the bottom of README.md.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-10-05

- Trend: a Robots card shows the signals RobControl records (registers, I/O,
  system variables) and plots them on the same time axis as PLC tags. Read from
  RobControl's database, read-only; Open... reads one from another PC.
- User guide rewritten for someone new to the tool: what it is for, a worked
  example, how it works, how accurate the timestamps are (and why the poll
  interval matters), a step-by-step first measurement, and more troubleshooting.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-10-02

- Fixed: moving the mouse over the window printed an error on every move
  (the Latency page's "Give up after" field was named in a way that hid a
  Qt method the window relies on). Renamed it and two others like it, and
  added tests that catch the whole class of mistake.
- Fixed: a font-size warning from the Live log's event badges.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-10-02

Rebuilt to match the family (File Manager, NetControl, Redline PDF) and cleaned up.

- New window in PySide6 on the shared design system: custom title bar with the
  menus and running-state chips, a page rail, cards, 11 themes x 6 accents x 3
  densities, follow Windows light/dark. No emojis.
- New Latency page: pairs every trigger with its response and reports
  min/median/mean/p95/max, unanswered triggers, a histogram, and CSV export.
- Trend: one chart per tag on a shared time axis, step-accurate lines, hover
  readout, any log file can be opened, validated colour palette.
- Live log: event badges, search, filter by kind, archive list.
- Port check is gentle by default (known PLC ports, 4 at a time); Fast is
  labelled bench-only. Results and connections send their address to the
  other pages by right-click.
- NetControl and File Manager are used when installed, never required.
- Service fixes: the installed exe now registers with the service manager
  properly, the service actually polls (the Unattended switches save
  `enabled`), Passive sniff and libplctag settings run under the service, the
  PLC is retried every 15 s, crashes restart it, and `service.log` records it.
- Config and logs moved to `C:\ProgramData\PLC Monitor\`; an existing config is
  copied across on first start.
- libplctag: per-tag data types now take effect (they were stored but ignored).
- Passive sniff stops promptly on a quiet line.
- Installer with GitHub update check; the in-app guide is README.md.
